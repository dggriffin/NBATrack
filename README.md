ExtJS 5.0 Real-time NBA Dashboard

This was a small side-project for a 72-hour challenge to create a real-time NBA dashboard using any front-end framework. 

I chose ExtJS 5.0 for my front-end. A scheduled PHP script routinely saves real-time game data to the server as an XML resource, and then ExtJS gets and consumes the resource through AJAX calls.
